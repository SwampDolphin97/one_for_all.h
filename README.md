## Introduction
Tired of Coding the same codes in C again and again? This repo is responsibly designed for functions callup so you don't have to do heavy coding in the deployment of any program. 

## Usage
Paste the one_for_all.h in the same directory as your source code. Exclude all the header files and put 
```
#include "one_for_all.h"
```
	
## Contribution
Anybody is welcomed to collaborate in this project. Feel free to create any pull request (even if you are new to coding).

Note: The idea of this project is to build a really simple blockchain system, so make sure all your code is easy to read (avoid too much code in 1 line) and don't introduce complex updates if they are not critical. In other words, keep it simple.


## Disclaimer
By no means this repo is made for copying purposes. It is created for helping beginners and making deployment faster.
